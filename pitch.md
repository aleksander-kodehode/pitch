### Hey I’m Aleksander!
I’m current learning how to code through “Kodehode”, in my spare time I enjoy messing around with selfhosting services and apps through Docker, playing interesting games that takes up way too much time. 
One of my big passions is cooking and collecting handmade Japanese knifes.
Recently I have been doing a deep dive into the world of coding, which I find extremely fun and instructive. 
I am mostly interested in how apps and websites work on the backend, but I find that styling and making things look good is also a lot of fun!
